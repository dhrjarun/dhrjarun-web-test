Yesterday, I was searching on reddit how to be a better writer and found a [blogpost](https://www.artofmanliness.com/career-wealth/career/want-to-become-a-better-writer-copy-the-work-of-others/) recommended by a random redditor. It introduced to me something called copywork. It is about deliberately practicing, by reading few sentences from a book you like and then write from your memory and compare to see where you made the mistakes, what's the difference. There are many variants of copy work used to be practiced by some great writers from which I could only recognize Ben Franklin's name. I found the method interesting. I will try after publishing this blog. Whom work should I try this method on. i love the book 'to kill a mocking bird', will try on it for sure. I would try on couple of bloggers like Jason Fried (may be on his books too) or DHH and [Alex Kondov's](https://alexkondov.com/) blog. There's an Indian writer Ruskin Bond, I love his book 'Blue Umbrella'. It is so simple, beautify and it's short, I would love to learn how he structure his sentences. His books are adored by kids and teenagers the most I think.

I was thinking about adding comments to my site. I will use github discussion for that, there a project -- I'll have to search which will let me instantly integrate it. This way the content, the discussion everything will be on github. It may outlive me, I don't know as long Microsoft don't go bankrupt. 

I have this domain dhrjarun.com which cost couple of bucks each year. For backup I will as well have dhrjarun.github.io, in case I won't be able to pay for the domain in the future.

I have an issue with TinaCMS, right now while writing, if I go back( previous page) by mistake, all my written data will be lost. It does not even warn me (do not show the alert dialog) to whether you really want to go back. It would have been great, if it has an auto-save mechanism to the local storage. Till now I'll have to be extra cautious.

Due to this I considered building a plugin for obsidian which could work as local CMS, but I have to focus on [my primary project](https://dhrjarun.com/now/2024-07-13) .
