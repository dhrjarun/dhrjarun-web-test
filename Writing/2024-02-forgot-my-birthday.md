xx-02-2024, Yesterday was my birthday, but I and everybody around me totally forgotten about it. It was my bank who remembered the day. I was casually checking my email on bed at night and there it was someone wishing me a happy birthday. Aft first, I laughed who the heck wishing me birthday today, well then I checked the date and i felt weird. well i used to wait for this day couple of days ago but now it just slipped away from me. It seems time is passing superfast. 1 month of the year just passed away and I felt nothing.

Now it's been more than a month on my project, I am in weird stae, I have made more than 100 commits, tried several things only to know they don't work. The initial ideas, structure of the project has changed. I have rewritten so many parts more than once. At the I was building a web app -- which will also be a PWA. Exploring PWA a bit on mobile and I found it doens't has a bit of experience as mobile especially on iOS. I did so much research on VirtualKeyboard only to be disappointed. So I decided to build react-native app as well, Later I dropped the idea in favour of other idea. The project is eveolving on its own and I being the creator doesn't have much control. I hope at the end the evolution lead to something useful.
