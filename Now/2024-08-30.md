As said in my last [now](https://dhrjarun.com/now/2024-07-13) page, that I will release the first version of [Dredge](https://github.com/dhrjarun/dredge/) by 15th august. I did by 17th august. Released three main npm packages dredge-route, dredge-fetch, dredge-adapters. But the project was lacking the documentation. 

As of now, I am creating docs, examples, will be making few videos. Need a docs website which I am thinking of using [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/). Along with that, I am gonna contact developers on twitter, show them my work, see if anybody like it. Post about it on typescript communities. Basically the marketing stuff. 

So, my primary work for 1-2 months will be to market Dredge. Other than that, If I come across any issue or bug which really need to be fixed and try to make Dredge production ready. Gonna avoid making any major changes to the design or implement any new features. 

Talking about daily life, I have not been playing any video games lately, neither I actively watch movies. Few days ago, I watched Furiosa, for 2 day I have been watching Oppenheimer. If there is nothing to watch then I play 'The office'. I am on 8th season, Michael has left the show. 

Sometimes I go for walk in fields. Before I had a friend who used to accompany me, but for some reason he cannot go anymore. So now I go by myself, which I love by the way - Finding my own path.
