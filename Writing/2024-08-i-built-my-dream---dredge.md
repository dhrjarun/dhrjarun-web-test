[Dredge](https://github.com/dhrjarun/dredge), my project I have the first version completed. To give a intro -- It is a way to build type-safe rest API. I had some sort of itch with building rest API since long time. When I tried, GraphQL, it was fixing some itch, but there were other itch. When I tried tRPC, it was too fixing itches, but there were still some old and new itch. I used to dream and think about something which fixes all my itch related to building API. I thought and thought, there were many ideas but I needed something concrete to begin working on. I got some, so I began the work in January I guess. Right now, when I see the project, its designs, It seems quite obvious, simple -- but It was not, I had to change a lot of stuff a lot of time, I was stuck sometime, then I thought of some new ideas. What I thought about Dredge in beginning is quite different now.

When you begin working on something, you might get a roadblock which can't be crossed presently. Hence, you can't finish the project, but I am glad, I was able to cross every roadblock so far. On the release, I had a damn life and death roadblock, but I breached it. I had so many moment of happiness, when I found solutions to something so threatening. I loved building it.

Now the next phase begins, Where I see, if anybody in this word relate with this dream of mine or not. I am gonna post about my work on communities. Cold DM couple of people. I have never done this marketing stuff, lets see how it goes. Man! I don't know, it feels unreal that I would be able to have success with Dredge. I never had any experience like that. I know how and what I think will not happen, world has its own way which I could hardly guess. But still I have expectations, which is to have more than 100 GitHub stars by the end of September? I would be amazed, if something I build would be useful to the others.

Let's see, by the end of September, how many people relate to my dream. I know, it will be a gradual process. But, I want at least 100 GitHub stars by then, otherwise I guess it would be failure. I will still love it....
