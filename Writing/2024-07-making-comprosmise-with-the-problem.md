Today, it was different than usual day me working on Dredge. I am stuck on an obstacle. I think there are couple of decisions to be made. Which has some inertia I need to overcome to go further. I used to work easily for more than 3 hours in the morning but today, due to not having the clarity about the implementation. I could not gather enough will to continue the work after 1.5 hours but at last, I did managed for 2 hours; but still not able to force open the roadblock. 

Took the nap for an hour, that's what I like about the nap, It's like the beginning of another day to me. I could forget whatever happened before, I fell into asleep (although my nap mostly consists of ram sleep and I am almost aware). If I would not have taken the nap, the entire day would have went me doing nothing. Nap gave me one more day in the same day. I once again approached the problem; but problem seem too persistent this time as well. I had to give up once again. 

It seems, I may have to compromise with the problem for a bit. May have to suppress my urge for perfection on this one. Instead of cleanly cutting my way through the mountain let's just do it haphazardly just enough to pass trough it. Right now it is important to go beyond and reach the destination on time. When time allows, I will come once again with new ideas to clear the blockage as perfect it needs to be.
