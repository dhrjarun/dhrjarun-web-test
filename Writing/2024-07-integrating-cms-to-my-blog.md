Today I added CMS to my blog. It used to be quite resistive for me to write blog. For instance: I had to first open VS Code then open this blog project. Now comes the writing part, and what can I say about it. Presenting my thoughts in VS Code is hard. Those little monospace fonts are best for coding not for writing stream of thoughts.

Since now I've lessened the resistance, I hope I'll be writing regularly.

It's TinaCMS, it took me a couple of days to make things work with my astro site. I was going for self-hosting, banged my head for few nights. But then today just an hour before, I checked Tina's cloud pricing and it had something for me -- the free version. Then integrating it was a piece of cake, did everything in under half an hour.

Couple of weeks ago I visited Terence Tao blog and there I found most of the blogs are one or two paragraph. I thought may be I should do the same. So I'll be writing mostly small blogs and it will be raw. It won't be fancy, edited like some magazine's columns. I am no professional writer. I am gonna make a lot of mistakes and nobody is gonna read it anyway.

This blog will be like my journal, I would write all sort of stuff, except the private stuff which will for my Diary.
